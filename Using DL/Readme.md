# 🧠 Emotion Detection using NLP (TensorFlow + Keras)

This project is an **Emotion Detection System** that predicts human emotions from text using  
**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning (Bi-LSTM + Attention)** implemented with  
**TensorFlow & Keras**.

A **Streamlit web application** is provided for real-time as well as **batch emotion prediction**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Understanding human emotions from text is a challenging task due to:
- Ambiguity in language
- Context dependency
- Overlapping emotions

This project aims to solve this by combining **NLP preprocessing** with a **deep learning model**
that can capture both **semantic meaning** and **context**.

## 😊 Emotions Supported

The model classifies text into the following emotions:

- 😊 **Joy**
- 😢 **Sadness**
- 😠 **Anger**
- 😨 **Fear**
- ❤️ **Love**
- 😲 **Surprise**

## 🚀 Features

- Deep Learning model (**Bi-LSTM + Attention**)
- Pretrained **GloVe word embeddings**
- High accuracy (**~92–94%**)
- Single & **multiple sentence prediction**
- User-friendly **Streamlit UI**
- Lightweight & easy to deploy
- No PyTorch dependency (TensorFlow only)
